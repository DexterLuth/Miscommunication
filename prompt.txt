Banker: Good morning, thanks for coming in. What can I help you with today?

Client: I’m looking to restructure some of my debt and understand whether a line of credit or a personal loan makes more sense.

Banker: Understood. Before we go into solutions, I want a quick snapshot. What’s the total amount you're looking to consolidate, and at what rates?

Client: Around $28,000 in total. Rates range between 14% and 19%.

Banker: All right. Two paths:
A line of credit gives flexibility and a variable rate. A structured loan locks you into a fixed rate and forces discipline. What’s the priority for you—lower monthly payments or predictable payoff timing?

Client: Predictability. I’d prefer to know exactly when the balance hits zero.

Banker: Then the personal loan is the stronger option. Based on your profile, you’d likely qualify for something between 8% and 11% over five years. That cuts your interest almost in half.

Client: What would the monthly payment look like?

Banker: Roughly in the $580–$610 range depending on rate confirmation. And no penalties for early repayment if things improve.

Client: That’s reasonable. What’s the next step?

Banker: I’ll run a soft check to confirm eligibility. If we’re green, we move to the formal application—takes about ten minutes. Funds typically land within 24 hours.

Client: Let’s go ahead with the check.

Banker: Perfect. I’ll get it started now.
