**Relevance to the Question (Yes/No)?** No

**Explanation:** The client's final explicit question, "What do you need from me to start?" was answered in the *preceding* paragraph by the banker (listing financial statements and identification documents). The banker's final reply addresses the process *after* the client provides the requested information (receiving the application, due diligence, and providing a written term sheet), rather than directly addressing the requirements needed to initiate the process.
