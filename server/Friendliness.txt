**Score: 4 (Friendly)**

**Justification:**

The banker maintains a highly professional, polite, and consistently helpful tone throughout the conversation. While the language is formal, required for the complex financial and regulatory topics, the banker demonstrates strong interpersonal consideration by:

1.  **Transparency:** Proactively explaining the regulatory constraints and non-negotiable elements clearly.
2.  **Managing Expectations:** Explicitly stating terms are "indicative" and noting they do not want to promise an unrealistic timeline ("I do not want to promise you a one-week close when that would not be realistic"). This honesty builds trust and approachability.
3.  **Positive Framing:** Using phrases like "so there are no surprises" and confirming a desire to proceed in a "fully compliant and transparent way," which indicates a helpful attitude toward the client experience.

The tone is welcoming (using "Good afternoon" and "Great" as acknowledgments) and focused on providing comprehensive clarity, making the banker highly approachable despite the serious nature of the business discussion. The lack of stronger emotional warmth (e.g., enthusiastic encouragement or personalized connection) prevents a score of 5, but the high level of professional consideration and politeness warrants a strong 4.
