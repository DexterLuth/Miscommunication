**Score: 4/5 (Friendly)**

**Justification:**

The banker demonstrates a high degree of professional politeness, clarity, and transparency, which establishes a very positive and trusting interpersonal tone, even if they lack informal warmth.

*   **Politeness and Professionalism:** The banker uses polite language ("Good afternoon," "Great," "Understood") and maintains a consistently respectful demeanor.
*   **Positive Interpersonal Tone via Transparency:** The banker makes proactive efforts to ensure the client understands all critical restrictions and potential pitfalls upfront ("I will walk through structure, costs, collateral, covenants, and constraints so there are no surprises"). This dedication to transparency is noted and appreciated by the client ("I appreciate the clarity," "I appreciate not being oversold on timing"), effectively translating detailed professionalism into a helpful and positive interaction.
*   **Approachability:** While the language is highly technical and regulatory-focused, the banker is structured and easy to follow. The willingness to manage expectations realistically (e.g., regarding the timeline: "I do not want to promise you a one-week close when that would not be realistic") makes the banker highly approachable and trustworthy, warranting a high score.
