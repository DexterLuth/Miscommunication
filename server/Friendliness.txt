**Score: 4 (Friendly)**

**Justification:**

The banker maintains a professional, polite, and highly proactive tone throughout the discussion, which contributes strongly to an overall sense of friendliness and approachability. The score is elevated above a standard "polite" (3) because of the banker's dedication to transparency and clarity.

*   **Transparency and Clarity:** The banker is explicitly focused on preventing surprises and ensuring the client understands the strict regulatory and policy constraints ("I need to be clear," "walk through structure... so there are no surprises," "begin the process in a fully compliant and transparent way"). This proactive communication style registers as helpful and trustworthy.
*   **Politeness and Validation:** The banker uses polite language and validates the client's concerns ("Understood," "Great," "Important point").
*   **Realistic Expectations:** The banker avoids overselling the product or timeline ("I do not want to promise you a one-week close when that would not be realistic"), demonstrating an honest approach that builds rapport.

The banker's warmth is demonstrated through a commitment to the client's understanding and a highly structured, non-ambiguous communication style. The only element preventing a score of 5 is the strictly formal language; there is no use of highly personalized or enthusiastic language to build immediate personal rapport.
