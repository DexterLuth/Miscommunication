**Score: 3** (Neutral/Professional)

**Justification:**

The banker is highly **polite** and professional, using standard courteous language ("Good afternoon," "Great," clear acknowledgments). However, the tone is strictly formal, instructional, and focused on compliance, legal disclaimers, and risk constraints. There is a complete lack of **warmth** or personal approachability. The language is dense with regulatory jargon (CIP, Regulation B, debt-to-EBITDA, negative covenants). While the clarity is excellent for a business discussion, the tone itself does not convey a positive **interpersonal** connection or friendliness. The banker sounds like a highly competent, formal guide through a complex process.
