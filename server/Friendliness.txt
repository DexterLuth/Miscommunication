**Score: 3 (Neutral/Professional)**

**Justification:**

The banker is highly professional, polite (opening with "Good afternoon" and using clear conversational markers like "Great" and "Understood"), and remarkably transparent. They repeatedly emphasize avoiding surprises and providing a realistic view of terms and timelines.

However, the tone remains strictly formal and transactional. The dialogue is dominated by technical jargon, regulatory warnings, and legal disclosures (non-binding, CIP, Regulation B, covenants). There is a complete lack of conversational warmth, enthusiasm, or personal approachability. The score reflects a high degree of respect and professionalism, but zero overt friendliness or relaxed interpersonal tone.
