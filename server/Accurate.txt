The banker’s explanation is exceptionally accurate. Every point—from regulatory compliance requirements (CIP, beneficial ownership, Regulation B) to standard commercial loan structures (term loan/revolver), typical costs (origination, commitment fees), collateral requirements (UCC, PG), and common financial covenants (DSCR 1.20x, Debt/EBITDA)—aligns perfectly with standard U.S. banking practices and federal regulations governing commercial lending.

The banker provides realistic expectations regarding timelines and explicitly highlights necessary constraints due to regulatory guidance and internal risk appetite, demonstrating full transparency and compliance. There are no misleading or factually incorrect statements.
