The agent (Banker) **did not include all mandatory requirements** identified in Stage 3.

The Banker provided robust disclosures regarding AML/CIP, Privacy Policy, Adverse Action Notice (Reg B), the definition of a completed application, and critically, the constraint posed by regulatory guidance on leveraged lending.

However, the following mandatory disclosures were omitted or insufficiently addressed:

### Missing Requirements

| Category | Requirement Omitted/Insufficiently Addressed | Transcript Check | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **II. Application/Timeline (ECOA)** | **Guarantees and Spousal Requirements:** The bank must disclose that personal guarantee requirements comply with ECOA standards, meaning a non-applicant spouse's signature cannot be automatically required unless necessary to perfect the lien on collateral. | Banker merely states: "We also normally require a personal guarantee from the majority owner." | This statement lacks the necessary ECOA caveat regarding spousal requirements, which is a mandatory disclosure for personal guarantees. |
| **III. Substantive Risk** | **Required Exit Strategy:** Disclosure that prudent underwriting requires a clear, defined, and credible secondary source of repayment or exit strategy (e.g., refinancing plan). | No mention of a requirement for a secondary source of repayment or an exit strategy for the loan. | This is a fundamental principle of sound underwriting, especially when discussing leverage, and was a required disclosure. |
| **III. Substantive Risk** | **Required Covenants and Reporting:** Explicitly disclose that the loan agreement requires mandatory regular financial reporting as an affirmative covenant. | Banker detailed financial covenants (DSCR, Leverage) and negative covenants (restrictions on debt/sales), but did not explicitly state that *regular financial reporting* (e.g., monthly/quarterly statements) is a required covenant. | While covenants were broadly covered, the specific requirement for ongoing financial reporting was a mandatory inclusion that was missed. |

**Conclusion:** The agent missed key legal (ECOA) and underwriting disclosures (Exit Strategy, Reporting Covenants), resulting in non-compliance with the full set of mandatory requirements.
