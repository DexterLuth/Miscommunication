The banker employed a structured and transparent approach, which aids understanding significantly, particularly by ensuring "no surprises" regarding constraints and non-negotiables.

However, the banker **did not utilize explicit confirmation questions** (like "Do you have any questions about that?" or "Does that timeline work for you?") throughout the conversation. The banker relied entirely on the client volunteering confirmation ("Understood," "All clear," "That makes sense").

The key moment where the banker ensured understanding was when the client summarized the complex relationship between flexibility, policy, and regulation:
*   Client: "So there is some flexibility, but within your policy and regulatory limits."
*   Banker: "Exactly." (This confirms the client accurately understood the core constraint.)

The banker's clarity and structure were high, but the active steps taken to verify understanding were limited.

**Score: 7/10**

**Justification:** The banker provided exceptional detail and transparency, leading the client to volunteer confirmation repeatedly ("I appreciate the clarity," "That gives me a realistic view"). Crucially, the banker explicitly confirmed the client’s summary of the complex covenant restrictions, which is a strong verification step. However, the lack of explicit confirmation questions (e.g., "Are there any items there that need further explanation?") prevents a higher score.
