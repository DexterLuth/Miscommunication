**Score: 9**

**Justification:**

The banker makes a very strong, consistent effort to ensure the client understands the complex, non-binding, and restrictive elements of the financing discussion. This assurance is achieved through several methods:

1. **Setting Expectations and Disclaimers:** The banker begins with clear, upfront disclaimers ("non-binding," "not a commitment") and confirms the client's immediate understanding ("Understood").
2. **Checking Understanding on Regulatory Points:** After detailing the complicated regulatory requirements (CIP/AML, Privacy, Reg B), the banker pauses and receives confirmation from the client ("That makes sense," "All clear").
3. **Proactive Summarization of Constraints:** The banker proactively frames the discussion to prevent "surprises" ("I will walk through structure, costs, collateral, covenants, and constraints so there are no surprises").
4. **Collaborative Confirmation on Complex Topics:** On the most critical topic—covenants and leverage limits (which directly impacts the client's goals)—the client summarizes the key takeaway: "So there is some flexibility, but within your policy and regulatory limits." The banker immediately affirms this summary ("Exactly."), proving the complex constraints were successfully communicated and understood.
5. **Managing Expectations (Timeline):** The banker explicitly avoids "overselling" the timeline, leading the client to confirm understanding of the realistic constraints ("I appreciate not being oversold on timing").
6. **Overall Conclusion:** The conversation ends with the client confirming the clarity of the entire process: "That gives me a realistic view of what to expect."

The banker receives high marks because they did not merely assume understanding; they presented detailed, restrictive information clearly and consistently received confirmation or acknowledgment that the information was processed, culminating in a strong summary check regarding the non-negotiable constraints.
