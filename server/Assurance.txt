This banker focused heavily on disclosure and transparency but made minimal effort to proactively verify that the client understood the complex financial and regulatory information provided.

**Evidence of Low Effort (Passive Assurance):**

*   The Banker never paused to ask the client, "Do you have any questions so far?" or "What parts of this are still unclear?"
*   The Banker relied entirely on the client volunteering confirmation ("Understood," "That makes sense," "All clear"). This is passive assurance.
*   The only point where the Banker actively affirmed the client's comprehension was when the client summarized the covenant constraint:
    *   Client: "So there is some flexibility, but within your policy and regulatory limits."
    *   Banker: "Exactly." (This is good feedback but was reactive, not an initiated check.)

The complexity of topics like beneficial ownership rules, financial covenants (DSCR and Debt-to-EBITDA), and the negative covenants affecting future acquisitions warranted several specific checks for understanding. Since the Banker relied solely on the client's brief affirmations without summarizing or inviting further questions, the effort to *ensure* understanding was low.

**Score: 4/10** (Clarity was high, but assurance/verification effort was low and passive.)
