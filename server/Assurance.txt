The banker excelled in clarity and organization, which facilitates client understanding. However, the banker primarily relied on the client's self-reported understanding ("Understood," "That makes sense," "All clear," "I appreciate the clarity") rather than using proactive techniques like confirmation questions or summarizing key points for verification.

**Strengths:**
*   The banker ensured that the client's accurate summary of a complex constraint ("So there is some flexibility, but within your policy and regulatory limits") was validated with "Exactly," demonstrating effective verification that the core limits were grasped.
*   The overall structure and transparency of the dialogue ensured that the client was continuously engaged and able to provide feedback that they were following along.

**Weaknesses (Why it's not a 9 or 10):**
*   The banker never explicitly asked, "Do you have any questions on that point?" or "How does that sound?" or "Can you summarize what the primary covenant requirements will be?" The verification was reactive, not proactive.

**Score: 7/10**
(Good effort on verifying clarity through responding to the client’s summary, but lacked explicit, proactive checks for understanding.)
