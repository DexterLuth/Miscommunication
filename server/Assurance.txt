The Banker scores highly on transparency and expectation management, which are strong methods of assuring understanding, although they rely primarily on clear statements rather than frequent confirmation questions.

**Evidence of Assurance:**

*   **Front-loading Constraints:** The Banker immediately clarified the preliminary, non-binding nature of the discussion, managing expectations from the start.
*   **Preventing Surprises:** The Banker stated the intent was to walk through structure, costs, collateral, covenants, and constraints "so there are no surprises."
*   **Explicit Confirmation of Summary:** When the Client summarized the key constraint regarding flexibility ("So there is some flexibility, but within your policy and regulatory limits."), the Banker confirmed with **"Exactly."** This demonstrates the Banker actively verified that the client understood the complex regulatory limitations.
*   **Managing Timelines:** The Banker specifically addressed unrealistic expectations: "I do not want to promise you a one-week close when that would not be realistic," ensuring the client had a clear, realistic view of the process.
*   **Procedural Summarization:** The final exchange clearly summarized the sequence of events (application -> due diligence -> term sheet -> approval -> closing), providing a structural check for understanding.

**Areas for Improvement (Preventing a 9 or 10):**

*   The Banker never used explicit checks for understanding, such as "Do you have any questions about the covenants we just discussed?" or "Could you walk me through your understanding of the default clause?" The Banker relied on the Client's unprompted affirmations ("Understood," "All clear").

**Score:** 8/10

**Justification:** The Banker demonstrated strong transparency, proactively outlined potential risks and constraints (covenants, timing, non-binding nature), and explicitly confirmed the client's correct understanding of the most critical structural constraint ("Exactly."). This comprehensive approach to clarity ensures a high level of understanding, even without frequent, explicit confirmation questions.
