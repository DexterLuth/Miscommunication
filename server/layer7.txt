    "clarity": "The banker provided an exceptionally clear, structured, and compliant explanation, using accurate regulatory references (like CIP, FinCEN CDD, and Reg B) to justify all mandatory steps and constraints.",
    "friendliness": "The banker maintained a highly professional and polite tone, proactively managing expectations and using positive framing, resulting in a strong score for professional approachability.",
    "assurance": "Although clarity was high, the banker's effort to proactively ensure client understanding was low, relying passively on client affirmations rather than initiating specific comprehension checks for complex topics.",
    "accurate": "The explanation was fully accurate, using precise banking terminology and correctly identifying all major regulatory obligations, standard loan structures (e.g., Term Loan/Revolver), and covenant requirements.",
    "structure": "The explanation was organized exceptionally well, following a highly logical sequence from mandatory regulatory prerequisites to loan specifics, adhering strictly to an explicitly stated agenda."
  },
  "overall_summary": "The banker demonstrated extremely high competency in technical accuracy, clarity, and structural organization, effectively justifying all mandatory requirements and loan constraints through precise references to regulatory mandates and standard banking practice. While the delivery was highly professional and polite, the overall average was negatively impacted by the banker's low proactive effort in assurance; the banker failed to pause and verify the client's understanding of the complex financial and legal disclosures."
