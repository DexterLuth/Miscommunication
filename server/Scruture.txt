This explanation is exceptionally well-structured and follows a highly logical and professional progression.

**Score: 10**

**Justification:**

The banker organized the explanation by first establishing necessary prerequisites (regulatory compliance and non-binding nature) and then presenting a clear, systematic roadmap for the loan terms.

1.  **Foundational Context:** The banker started with necessary disclaimers and then immediately addressed three non-negotiable regulatory requirements (CIP/AML, Privacy, Reg B timing). This established compliance first.
2.  **Clear Agenda Setting:** After the client stated their goal, the banker explicitly laid out the agenda: "I will walk through structure, costs, collateral, covenants, and constraints."
3.  **Step-by-Step Adherence:** The banker then followed this agenda precisely, covering each topic logically before moving to the next:
    *   Structure (Product type, size, term)
    *   Costs (Pricing, fees, third-party expenses)
    *   Collateral and Default (Security interest, guarantees)
    *   Covenants and Constraints (Financial, Negative, and regulatory limits impacting client’s goal)
4.  **Process Conclusion:** The explanation concluded logically with the necessary logistics: Timeline and Required Documents.

There is **no topic jumping** and the coherence is excellent, making the complex information easy for the client to track and digest. This represents a model structure for a banking term discussion.
