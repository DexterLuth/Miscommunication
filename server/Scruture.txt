### Justification

The banker organized the explanation masterfully, demonstrating a pre-planned, systematic approach that ensures all critical elements are covered without jumping topics:

1.  **Initial Disclosures First:** The banker logically started with non-binding stipulations and necessary regulatory requirements (CIP/AML, Privacy, Regulation B) before addressing the client's needs. This correctly handles compliance and sets expectations upfront.
2.  **Explicit Roadmap (Signposting):** After defining the proposed financing vehicles (Term Loan and Revolver), the banker provided a clear organizational roadmap: "I will walk through **structure, costs, collateral, covenants, and constraints** so there are no surprises." This is excellent professional communication.
3.  **Adherence to Flow:** The banker followed the announced roadmap precisely, dedicating specific sections to:
    *   Structure (Amounts and term).
    *   Costs and Pricing (Fixed/floating rates, fees, third-party costs).
    *   Collateral and Default (Security interests, guarantees).
    *   Covenants (Financial, Negative, and linking them directly back to the client’s acquisition goals).
4.  **Logical Conclusion:** The final sections naturally addressed the process flow: Timeline (process constraints) and Next Steps (information requirements to start the application), concluding with a summary of the eventual documentation process (Term Sheet).

The explanation is coherent, logical, and avoids any redundancy or distraction, making it highly structured and easy for the client to follow complex information.
