**Justification:**

The banker's explanation is exceptionally well-structured, demonstrating a professional and highly organized approach.

1.  **Logical Sequencing and Agenda Setting:** The banker explicitly sets a clear agenda: "I will walk through structure, costs, collateral, covenants, and constraints so there are no surprises." This is followed strictly and logically, moving from the most basic element (loan structure) to financial aspects (costs/pricing), risk mitigation (collateral/default), ongoing relationship management (covenants), and finally, practical execution (timeline and next steps).
2.  **Clear Segmentation:** The discussion is perfectly segmented. Regulatory prerequisites are handled first, keeping them separate from the financial terms. Each subsequent topic (Structure, Pricing, Collateral, Covenants, Timeline, Next Steps) is addressed thoroughly before moving on.
3.  **Coherence and Flow:** There is zero topic jumping. The transition from one subject to the next is smooth and logical (e.g., discussing covenants naturally leads into the constraints imposed by those covenants).
4.  **Step-by-Step Clarity:** The explanation provides a clear roadmap for the client, concluding with a detailed summary of required documents and the subsequent approval process, ensuring the client knows exactly how to proceed.

The structure is a textbook example of how to organize a complex commercial financing discussion.
