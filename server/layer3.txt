Based on the analysis in Stage 2, the following requirements and mandatory notices must be formally disclosed to the client. These disclosures manage expectations regarding timelines, documentation, and the regulatory constraints on the final loan structure.

## Stage 3: Mandatory Disclosures to the Client

### I. Mandatory Legal Notices and Policies

These disclosures relate to the institution’s compliance obligations and must be provided to the client in writing.

| Requirement Category | Disclosure Requirement | Regulatory Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Privacy Notice** | The bank must provide a written **Privacy Policy Notice** (Reg P) detailing how the client’s Non-Public Personal Information (NPPI) collected during the **Underwriting** process will be protected, used, and potentially shared with necessary third parties (e.g., appraisers, legal counsel for **Due Diligence**). | GLBA / Regulation P |
| **B. Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** | The bank must disclose that verification of the legal entity's identity is mandatory and requires compliance with the BSA/CDD Rule. This includes the collection and verification of identifying information for all **Beneficial Owners** (individuals holding 25% or more equity) and the single control person of the business. | BSA / CDD Rule (FinCEN) |
| **C. Collateral Perfection** | The client must be informed that the loan structure requires the bank to establish and maintain a **First-position security interest** in the agreed-upon collateral. This involves the client cooperating with the bank's **Legal Due Diligence** and the filing of UCC financing statements (UCC-1 filings) in the appropriate jurisdictions. | Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) |
| **D. Adverse Action Notice** | The client must be informed that if the application is ultimately denied or approved with conditions significantly different from those requested (counteroffer), the bank is legally required to provide an Adverse Action Notice detailing the reasons for the decision. | Regulation B (ECOA) |

### II. Application and Timeline Requirements (Regulation B & BSA)

These requirements govern how the client's requested **Timeline** for a decision is legally managed.

1.  **Definition of a Completed Application:** The bank must clearly define what constitutes a **Completed Application**. The 30-day clock for a lending decision (as requested by the customer) *does not* begin until the bank has received all required documentation, including:
    *   Financial statements and tax returns for the legal entity.
    *   Completed and signed Beneficial Ownership forms (BSA/CDD).
    *   Required information on the proposed collateral (e.g., existing liens, appraisal needs).

2.  **Guarantees and Spousal Requirements:** The bank must disclose that any requirement for a **Personal Guarantee** must comply with ECOA standards. The bank cannot automatically require the signature of a non-applicant spouse solely based on policy, unless the spouse is a joint applicant or their signature is necessary under state law to perfect the bank's lien on jointly-owned collateral.

3.  **Mandatory Identity Verification:** The client must be notified that the AML/CDD requirements (identifying Beneficial Owners) are mandatory compliance steps that **must be completed and verified prior to finalizing the Term Sheet** and initiating full credit **Underwriting**. Failure to provide this information will prevent the application from being considered "completed."

### III. Substantive Risk and Underwriting Constraints

These disclosures manage the client's expectations regarding the flexibility of **Covenants** and maximum **Leverage**.

1.  **Regulatory Constraint on Leverage:** The bank must disclose that the requested financing structure is subject to regulatory guidance on **Leveraged Lending**. The negotiation of the **Maximum Leverage** ratio (**Debt-to-EBITDA**) and **DSCR** will be constrained by the bank's internal credit policy, which is guided by interagency standards often flagging debt levels above 4.0x or 5.0x as heightened risk.

2.  **Required Exit Strategy:** The bank must disclose that prudent **Underwriting** requires a clear, defined, and credible secondary source of repayment or exit strategy (e.g., asset sale, refinancing plan) for highly leveraged structures.

3.  **Required Covenants and Reporting:** The client must be informed that the final loan agreement will contain mandatory affirmative and negative **Covenants** (e.g., limitations on future indebtedness, asset sales, and distributions) to protect the bank's collateral and maintain the business's financial health, limiting the customer's "maximal flexibility." Regular financial reporting will also be a required covenant.
